Polyglot programming is the understanding and knowledge of a wide range and paradigms of programming.

I had been enjoying writing code in Ruby, Python, NodeJS, GoLang and PHP and while doing so i am exposed to certain conditions when writing any of the languages.

Even though i had been a fan of C programming for many years which limits my scope more into systems development, it was in the recent years (circa 2011-2012), i had been exploring with Ruby and it was enjoyable for a person who just started into Web Development.

With Ruby, i used Ruby On Rails framework (which i still use today to prototype - fast enough to make an MVP, or Minimum-Viable Product).

Differences in the languages helped me to be flexible in solving a problem with the paradigms it shows and apply to any other languages besides the language i am working on.

For example, while working with Python, we use `try` and `catch` a lot to make errors more forgiving. I learned Python after dabbling with Ruby and i applied what i learned in Python with Python's equivalent of `try` and `catch` with Ruby's own `begin` and `except`. 

In other applications where we required to re-engineer a monolithic application to micro-services, i knew i had to scale the code that collects analytics data with GoLang and once we could not scale our PHP reporting app, so i rewrite it in Python. I had been using Python for generating reports using *Pandas* python library which was quick!

GoLang is the language that i enjoy writing most because i came from a C language background and i loved performance and that Golang had concurrency as a first-class citizen.

I had been dabbling with Haskell for a while but while i liked a language that is pure functional the lazy loading (have you even ran out of memory?) and having no-side effects is what i loved most but i couldn't apply it in production and it remains as a more hobby language for me.

After 15 years as a systems engineer with not much software development knowledge but now, it makes me more flexible in taking development roles and at the same time, enhance the infrastructure with network engineering on most parts like clustering and failover.

Sometimes you have to be more pragmatic by allowing a whole lot of options when developing software. 

Using and understanding one computer language throughout your life is not going to benefit you or anyone around you and you will be sticked to the narrow path not knowing that you can write the same code in the language you can only work on with less time and even lines of code!
