My Lenovo Carbon X1 Gen12 ships with a specific version of Quectel RM520N-GL 5G module, different than the stock Quectel RM520N-GL module that
can be bought from Quectel. How i knew this was that Lenovo's version of the module has a different *device id*.

So if you want to upgrade the Quectel RN520N-GL that comes with your Lenovo laptop, you have to refer it from Lenovo's support page and **NOT FROM QUECTEL**.

For example, I am running PopOS! 22.04 which is a variant of Ubuntu, so i would go to Lenovo's Website and look for **Quectel Firmware Switching Tool** which
is a firmware upgrade tool. 

I don't know why Lenovo calls it "Firmware Switching Tool" instead of "Firmware *Upgrade* Tool" but i am using this to upgrade my Quectel RM520N-GL firmware, which
does the download of the files automatically and safely upgrades the firmware.
