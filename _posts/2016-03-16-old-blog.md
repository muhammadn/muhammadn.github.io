I do search about myself on search engine but a few days back i started googling "Muhammad Nuzaihan FreeBSD" (you are not likely to find it with just "Muhammad Nuzaihan") and found my old blog at [https://polycompute.wordpress.com/2014/07/](https://polycompute.wordpress.com/2014/07/) and discovered a really important picture of where i was in early 2000s.

Here is the glorified image of me running (from right), FreeBSD on Intel Pentium as webserver, OpenBSD on a 486-DX2-66 as a mail server (because of the advanced anti-spamming feature they had with OpenBSD's SPAMD/PF) and NetBSD on 486-DX2-66 as a mere testing server.

I could host all those stuff below on a static IP which my ISP provides then (the now defunct Singtel Magix).
