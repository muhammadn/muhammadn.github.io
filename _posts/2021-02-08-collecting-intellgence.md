The scammer(phisher) had shutdown onlinemaycampaign.com and hosted it on another domain running at campaignmay2u.com using the same phishing codes as onlinemaycampaign.com.

I had only reacted by attacking the phisher again after a victim lost thousands of ringgits after the phisher got his SMS TAC and bought game credits, after that i got in touch with the victim to get in contact with the investigation officer.

This scammer was persistent in his (or her) criminal activity and i had to change my strategy and i managed to extract data from campaignmay2u.com, saved as CSV and JSON (complete with victim's IP and time the victim submitted in Turkish timezone and a lot more) of the data.

All these data was submitted to the authorities as evidence.

Although campaignmay2u.com is now pointing to another IP address, i can still access the criminal's phishing site by altering and pointing the correct IP to that domain in my computer's hosts file.

So i am waiting for the authorities to tell me to purge the sensitive data as i they might need those information, if necessary.
