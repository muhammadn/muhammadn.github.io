Why i still use VIM for most of my coding needs?

Well, i started off as a system administrator and for most of the time i would shell into the server and run my favorite editor.

I recall once when i was starting to use Linux, around 1997, i used the now obselete pico and then my co-worked introduced me to `vi`

While the overhead of `vi` over network was good, i started to write code on my local machine in C using `vi`.

Many years later, i still use a variant of `vi` called `vim`.

But okay, enough for the history as to how i got to use vim. Vim to be is flexible as i can write in PHP, Ruby, Python, Node and Go with vim flawlessly supporting the languages the needs of coding in almost every language i want to write it without purchasing an editor for each language.

Example: IntelliJ has `PyCharm`, `PHPStorm`, `RubyMine` and i don't want to purchase IDEs that make me "Buy" for a specific programming langauge. Do not get me wrong, they are GREAT IDEs and helps my co-workers to manage their code but i hated the idea of buying something that i will use 10% of the time. (I write in various languages - i don't stick to one language)

The only exception of the product IntelliJ had created that i use as an IDE - Android Studio (no choice, dude, it's Java) and there isn't an option to help me write Java code well. (even so, i hated Android Studio, especially when it suggests a wrong UI variable, for example). You have absolutely no choice but to use an IDE in Java to be honest.

I could use Sublime, but i still have problems getting the hang of it. Or maybe TextMate (it's clean and nice but it is macOS only - i do use Linux as my workstation at times when i don't have a Mac).

Maybe i will use Sublime for my primary editor but i still love having to work on a terminal because of it's flexibility.
