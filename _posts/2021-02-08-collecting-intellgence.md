The scammer(phisher) had shutdown onlinemaycampaign.com and hosted it on another domain running at campaignmay2u.com using the same phishing codes as onlinemaycampaign.com.

I had only reacted by attacking the phisher again after a victim lost thousands of ringgits after the phisher got his SMS TAC and bought game credits, after that i got in touch with the victim to get in contact with the investigation officer.

This scammer was persistent in his (or her) criminal activity and i had to change my strategy and i managed to find the flaws from campaignmay2u.com, got the data which is saved as CSV and JSON of all the critical evidence.

All these data was submitted to the authorities as evidence.

Although campaignmay2u.com is now pointing to another IP address, i can still access the criminal's phishing site by altering and pointing the correct IP to that domain in my computer's hosts file.

So i am waiting for the authorities to tell me to purge the sensitive data as the i might need those provide information, if the authorities felt were incomplete.
